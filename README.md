## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd phutabol

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
from phutabol.data.collector import DataCollector, MockDataSource
from phutabol.prediction.models import PoissonModel

# Initialize components
data_source = MockDataSource()
collector = DataCollector(data_source)

# Get teams and make prediction
teams = await data_source.get_teams("Premier League")
home_team, away_team = teams[0], teams[1]

model = PoissonModel()
prediction = model.predict_match(home_team, away_team, home_metrics, away_metrics)

print(f"Home Win: {prediction.home_win_probability:.1%}")
print(f"Draw: {prediction.draw_probability:.1%}")
print(f"Away Win: {prediction.away_win_probability:.1%}")
```

### Run the API Server

```bash
# Start the API server
python -m phutabol.api.main

# Or run the example script
python example_usage.py
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` for interactive API documentation.

### Run Examples

```bash
python example_usage.py
```

## Prediction Models

### 1. Poisson Model
Basic model assuming goals follow Poisson distribution.
- **Best for**: Quick predictions, baseline comparisons
- **Strengths**: Fast, simple, interpretable

### 2. Dixon-Coles Model
Enhanced Poisson model with adjustments for low-scoring games.
- **Best for**: More accurate than basic Poisson
- **Strengths**: Better modeling of 0-0, 1-0, 1-1 scores

### 3. Elo-based Model
Uses team strength ratings that evolve over time.
- **Best for**: Long-term team strength assessment
- **Strengths**: Accounts for team strength evolution

### 4. Bivariate Poisson Model
Accounts for correlation between home and away team goals.
- **Best for**: High-quality detailed predictions
- **Strengths**: Models goal correlation in tempo

### 5. Ensemble Model
Combines multiple models for improved accuracy.
- **Best for**: Most important predictions
- **Strengths**: Best overall accuracy, robust

## Performance Metrics

The system tracks multiple performance metrics:

- **Result Accuracy**: Percentage of correct match outcomes (W/D/L)
- **Score Accuracy**: Percentage of exact score predictions
- **Log Loss**: Probabilistic accuracy measure
- **Brier Score**: Probability calibration metric
- **Goals MAE/RMSE**: Goal prediction accuracy
- **Market-specific**: Over/Under, Both Teams to Score accuracy

## Data Sources

Currently supports:
- **Mock Data Source**: For development and testing
- **Football API Source**: Template for real API integration (requires API key)

Easily extensible to support:
- Football-Data.org API
- RapidAPI Sports APIs
- Custom data feeds
